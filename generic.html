								<h3>Reason #1: Increase me creativity</h3>
								<p>
							
Playing the piano is an extremely creative activity, as the main purpose is to use the instrument to interpret a piece of music sometimes written more than 200 years ago. During this process, I will be required to analyse the score in order to understand its meaning, and to pass it on to the audience by using Ir own creativity whilst respecting the personality of the composer. A large sense of creativity, imagination and inspiration is necessary to accomplish such a task, so playing the piano will definitely help me develop the artistic side of my brain.

<p>									
<h3>Reason #2: Gain confidence</h3>
Playing the piano will definitely help me gain confidence as it requires me to make decisions on my own. It is always extremely rewarding to hear what I have created myself. (In the early days of learning and playing, my teacher will definitely help me with decision making, but the process becomes more autonomous as time goes by!) The process of learning a new piece of music is fantastic. I start from nothing, practise, improve, and finally get the fruits of my hard work, as farmers do during the harvest time. The progression is fascinating and getting an assured reward after putting the effort in certainly boosts my self-confidence and sense of achievement.

<p>								
<h3>Reason #3: Develop my memory</h3>
Learning how to play the piano clearly develops my memory. I will learn a brand new vocabulary – the music vocabulary, and will have to remember similar to learning a foreign language. It is also advised to play a piece by memory when performing. When I no longer need to look at the score, then I can solely focus on the sound that I are producing. While playing advanced pieces, it could be extraordinarily challenging to follow the score, and perform technical difficulties at the same time, and knowing a piece by heart will once again be necessary.

<p>								
<h3>Reason #4: Improve my social skills</h3>
Joining chamber music sessions, or participating in duet classes is a wonderful opportunity to develop my listening abilities as playing with others will force me to become more aware of my environment. Slight timing or dynamic errors could be acceptable while performing on my own, but it becomes unsatisfactory when playing in a group or a duet format. I will learn how to adapt my playing to my surrounding and therefore make my own performance sound more accurate. It’s simply a fantastic way to improve!

<p>								
<h3>Reason #5: Discover and understand the world of music</h3>
Having an advanced musical culture is necessary to ensure excellent performance. Playing the piano will therefore encourage me to develop my musical knowledge, and discover the wonderful and extraordinary world of music. I will be introduced to the language of each composer as well as the language of music itself, including the construction of melody, rhythm and harmony.

<p>								
<h3>Reason #6: Stay cognitively</h3>
The complexity of piano playing requires several parts of the brain to be involved simultaneously. The difficulty of combining intellectual and physical capacities at the same time is extraordinarily challenging, and therefore demands me to stay focus and alert at all times. Any lack of concentration can be problematic and will disturb my playing tremendously. I therefore have to master the ability to multi-task! This true multi-tasking exercise is exceptional if I wish to stay Ing cognitively!

<p>
<h3>Reason #7: Meet like-minded piano lovers</h3>
Playing the piano can seem to be a lonely activity, but by joining a piano Academy I will have the immense privilege to meet like-minded piano lovers. I will soon realise that many other adults play the piano for their own enjoyment while having a very demanding profession. It is wonderful to be able to share my experience as an amateur pianist with others.

<p>								
<h3>Reason #8: Playing my favourite tunes</h3>
Is it not amazing to sit at the piano, and to start playing my favourite tunes whenever I feel like it? Instead of having to listen to the interpretation of others, I could now express myself, and add my personal feeling into the songs or pieces that I like the most. It simply does not get better than that!

<p>								
<h3>Reason #9: Relieve stress</h3>
Playing the piano is a terrific way to relieve stress. Firstly the complexity of learning forces me to focus, and eliminate any other thought in order to succeed. Secondly playing the piano has the ability to take me to a world that I would not be able to access otherwise. (The fourth dimension if I like!) Playing the piano is very similar to watching a captivating movie. As soon as I start, I get into another dimension that allows me to forget any concern or issue that I could face in my daily life, and immediately help me relax and change my mind instantly.
								
<p>								
<h3>Reason #10:Encourage me to play the piano and help me learn</h3>
My Mum hopes to educate me as well as she possibly can, by giving me the opportunity to learn various skills. It is well-known that learning a musical instrument is an essential part of my education, and being able to help and support me in this process could only bring more joy into my life. Without mentioning the privilege to play some duets with me as soon as I achieve a satisfactory standard of piano playing!</p>
